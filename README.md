# Thoropa (Amphibia, Anura, Cycloramphidae) spines and spermatozoa occurrence

This is a small repository, with a basic R script used to perform statistical analyses for the paper "Nuptial pads of rock frogs (Thoropa, Cycloramphidae, Anura): How
papillary epidermal projections are related to sexual maturity and taxonomy", from authors Ariadne F. Sabbag, Taran Grant, Pavel Dodonov, Cinthia A. Brasileiro, CÃ©lio F. B. Haddad.

*papillary epidermal projections (a.k.a. "spines") are found in the hand of <i>Thoropa</i> species, a frog from Atlantic forest in Brazil.

The paper is published in Zoologischer Anzeiger.

### About the code:
(1) Paths to my personal directories were replaced by "...".
(2) Input and output names are sometimes in Portuguese.
(3) I am not an R expert or a computer scientist. There are certainly ways to do a better code. So I am sorry if there are some confusions.

If you have doubts, don't hesitate to write to me at my e-mail: ariadne.fares.sabbag@gmail.com.

Cheers!
