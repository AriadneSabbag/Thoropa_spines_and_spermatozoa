# Thoropa (Amphibia, Anura, Cycloramphidae) spines and spermatozoa occurrence

This is a small repository, with a basic R script used to perform statistical analyses for the paper "Rock frog nuptial pads: the relationship between PEPs  and sexual maturity and its relevance for species taxonomy (Thoropa, Cycloramphidae, Anura)", from authors Ariadne F. Sabbag, Taran Grant, Pavel Dodonov, Cinthia A. Brasileiro, CÃ©lio F. B. Haddad.

*PEPs are papillary epidermal projections (a.k.a. "spines") found in the hand of <i>Thoropa</i> species, a frog from Atlantic forest in Brazil.

The paper is submitted to Zoologischer Anzeiger.

### About the code:
(1) Paths to my personal directories were replaced by "...".
(2) Input and output names are sometimes in Portuguese.
(3) I am not an R expert or a computer scientist. There are certainly ways to do a better code. So I am sorry if there are some confusions.

If you have doubts, don't hesitate to write to me at my e-mail: ariadne.fares.sabbag@gmail.com.

Cheers!
